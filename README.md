## Introducing the dead.yen emote menu - The Ultimate Emote and Animation Collection!

Unlock a world of expression and fluidity with our RedM Emote Menu! Packed with over 250 handpicked animations, emotes, and dances, this comprehensive menu is designed to elevate your role-playing experience in RedM to unprecedented heights.

Finding the right emote for your character has never been easier! With our easy-to-use search feature, you can quickly discover and access specific emotes within seconds. No more scrolling endlessly through a long list.

We understand the importance of muscle memory in role-playing, especially for seasoned FiveM players. That's why we've used names that align with what you might already be used to. Now, you can seamlessly transition your muscle memory from FiveM to RedM, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted role-playing experience.

## Features:
* Over 250 handpicked animations, emotes, and dances to choose from.
* Static and moving variations for each emote and dance.
* Smooth "hands-up" and "crossing hands" keybind animations.
* Muscle memory-friendly names familiar to FiveM players.
* Easy-to-use search feature for quick access to specific emotes.
* Customize your character's walking style and speed to match your role-play persona.
* Smooth ragdoll function without any twitching.
